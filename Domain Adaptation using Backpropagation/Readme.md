The goal of Domain Adaptation is to transfer the knowledge of a model to a different but related data distribution. 
The model is trained on a source dataset and applied to a target dataset (usually unlabeled). 
The model will be trained on regular MNIST images and then good performance is observed on MNIST with random color (without any labels).
